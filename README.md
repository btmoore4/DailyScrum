## Overview

A simple iOS application used to help our development stand up meetings with two things: 
* Assigns a random order for our developers to give their statuses 
* Times each developer and indicates if they are over their time 

It also uses the AVSpeechSynthesizer API to announc the start of each developer's turn and also announces the total time taken at the end of the stand up.
